STL Complement
==============

A few **small** goodies I wish were part of the `Standard Template Library`_. It
is not intended to contain complex algorithms that would be candidates for
`Boost`_ or other libraries, just small variations, adaptations and idioms
constructed over what's already available.

The namespace used for all utilities here is ``stdc``, which keeps it short and
reminds of the *complement* nature to the ``std`` namespace.

Contents:

.. toctree::

   algorithm
   functional
