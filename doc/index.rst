   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to STL Complement's documentation!
==========================================

A few **small** goodies I wish were part of the Standard Template Library. It is
not intended to contain complex algorithms that would be candidates for `Boost`_
or other libraries, just small variations, adaptations and idioms constructed
over what's already available.

The namespace used for all utilities here is ``stdc``, which keeps it short and
reminds of the *complement* nature to the ``std`` namespace.

Contents:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
